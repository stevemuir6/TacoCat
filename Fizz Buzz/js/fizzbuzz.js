//The premise of FizzBuzz is to take 2 user inputs and find all of their multiples between 1 and 100
//If the loop count is a multiple of input 1 it is a Fizz case
//If the loop count is a multiple of input 2 it is a Buzz case
//If the loop count is a multiple of both input it is a FizzBuzz case
//The order you test is MIGHT be very important
